Skycast Weather is weather application, where users can search weathers by location and gain current weather and 7 days forecasts.

Here are some of the tools I have used:

React - This was the JavaScript framework used to build this application.
Google Map API - Geolocation API - I used Google Map API - geolocation API to retrieve location information of the inputter location in the search bar.
Dark Sky API (Weather API) - I used Dark Sky API, weather API to retrieve current and future weather conditions of the inputted location.
